## Key Detection
```
We're given an HTML document with...basically nothing. There's a script tag in the document header that loads a JavaScript file from Cornify.com which will inject an image of a unicorn (ðŸ¦„ðŸ¦„ðŸ¦„!) into the DOM and a p element on the bottom of the page if we call cornify_add(). The goal of this challenge is to generate new unicorns every time the user succesfully enters a letter of 'secret code' that we will decide on.
