What is Event bubbling ?
=> When innermost element is clicked and an event is registered on it,
then that event gets bubbled up all the way to all the parent elements of the selected element upto html.
By default, this is setting of most browsers.

What is Event propagation ?
=> event registered on an element , bubbles up/down.
=> if we use e.stopPropagation() method then event stops propagating up/down.

What is Event capturing ?
=> if capture flag in addEventListener() is set to true then events run on the way bubble down
   else capture flag is set to false and event bubbles up on the way up as by default.

+ using once flag of addEventListener() method  , then once => true then method unbinds(listener removed) itself after it runs for once

bubble up mean from child to parent
bubble down mean from parent to child
