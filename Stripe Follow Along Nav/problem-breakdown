1. when hover over the nav links , 
    different nav link should generate different dropdown

2. When mouseenter event occurs, dropdown corresponding to correct element is drawn

First we need to create a dropdown(div) that will be able to resize itself dynamically 
based on which nav link it enters and fill  the dropdown(div) with the content corresponding to nav link

Then we need to add appropriate class to the dropdown dynamically.

when mouse leaves, class should be removed dynamically.

(difference between hover and mouseenter?=> hover=> mouseenter+mouseleave, mouseenter when mouse just enters the element)
(At which boundary(i.e margin,padding,etc) element starts detecting whether mouse has entered?)
